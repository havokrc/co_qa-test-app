# QA Automation Engineer — Technical Assessment

**Duration:** 2 hours
**Language:** Python

## Overview

You are given a running **Vulnerability Management Dashboard** composed of two microservices and a PostgreSQL database. The system tracks security vulnerabilities detected across your organization's assets (servers, containers, applications).

Your task is to write automated tests that verify the system works correctly — and find any bugs.

The system is already running via Docker. You don't need to modify the application code.

}
```

### Dashboard API (port 8000)

Manages findings lifecycle, statistics, and serves the UI.

| Method | Endpoint                     | Description                              |
|--------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/findings`                  | List findings (paginated, filterable)    |
| GET    | `/findings/{id}`             | Get finding detail with CVE info         |
| POST   | `/findings`                  | Create a finding manually                |
| PUT    | `/findings/{id}/status`      | Update finding status                    |
| DELETE | `/findings/{id}`             | Dismiss a finding                        |

| GET    | `/stats/risk-score`          | Calculate overall risk score             |
| GET    | `/stats/summary`             | Summary counts by status and severity    |

| GET    | `/health`                    | Health check                             |

**Filter params (findings):** `?status=open&severity=critical&asset_id=1`

**Create finding payload:**
```json
{
  "asset_id": 1,
  "vulnerability_id": 3,
  "scanner": "Nessus",
  "notes": "Detected during routine scan"
}
```

**Update status payload:**

### Database Schema

```sql
assets:           id, hostname, ip_address, asset_type, environment, os, is_active, created_at
vulnerabilities:  id, cve_id, title, description, severity, cvss_score, published_date, created_at
findings:         id, asset_id, vulnerability_id, status, detected_at, resolved_at, scanner, notes, is_dismissed
scans:            id, asset_id, scanner_name, status, started_at, completed_at, findings_count
```

## Your Tasks

### Part 1 — API Testing
Write pytest-based tests for the **Dashboard API**:
- Findings CRUD operations (create, read, update status, dismiss)
- Error handling (invalid inputs, non-existent resources)
- Edge cases (invalid status values, boundary values)
- Validate response status codes, response structure, and data correctness
- Test the search endpoint

### Part 2 — Database Validation
Connect directly to PostgreSQL and write tests that:
- Verify data integrity after API operations (e.g., dismiss a finding via API → query DB → verify `is_dismissed` is TRUE)
- Check that database constraints enforce data quality (e.g., CVSS score ranges, required fields)
- Validate consistency between findings, vulnerabilities, and assets tables

### Part 3 — Integration Testing
Test cross-service flows:
- Run a scan via Scanner Service → verify findings created in Dashboard API
- Update finding status → verify DB state matches
- Test what happens with concurrent scan imports (optional but valuable)

### Part 4 — UI Smoke Test with Playwright
Write 1-2 Playwright tests:
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`, verify the dashboard loads with findings
- Change a finding's status through the UI dropdown and verify the change is reflected

### Part 5 — Bug Report (10 min)
Document any bugs you found during testing. For each bug:
- **Title** — short description
- **Severity** — Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Steps to reproduce**
- **Expected vs actual behavior**

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium

# Run your tests
pytest
```

Place all test files in the `tests/` directory. You're free to create any folder structure, conftest files, or helper modules you need.

## Tips
- The application **has bugs** — finding and documenting them is part of the assessment
- Code quality matters: clean structure, good naming, proper assertions
- Don't spend all your time on one section — coverage across all parts is important
- You can use the interactive API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and `http://localhost:8001/docs`
- The seed data includes real-world CVE references — familiarize yourself with the data before writing tests

Good luck!
